            <p>This is a report analyzing 2019 QS university ranking and only concentrates at top 200 universities
                ranked by QS ranking. We are highly interested in finding a relationship in these top universities and
                understands more about these universities.</p><br>

                        correlates
                        to university ranking?</span><br><br>
                    This visualisation show correlation between<span class='GDP_text'> GDP per capita</span>, <span
                        class='freedom_text'>freedom to make choices score</span>, and
                    the number of top 200 universities in each country. In the graph,
                    we can see the countries which have
                    more than 5 top 200 universities are mostly having <span
                        class='GDP_text'>GDP per capita</span> above 1.3. Moreover, the countries
                    which have more than 10 top 200 universities are all having <span
                        class='freedom_text'>freedom scores</span> between 0.4 and 0.5 which
                    is very interesting.
                    <br>
                    Overall, we can conclude that the countries having <span class='GDP_text'>GDP per capita</span>
                    higher than 1.3 and <span class='freedom_text'>freedom to make life
                        choices score</span> between 0.4 and 0.5 is more likely to have a University that is in top 200.

                    <span class='title_text'>How does each country's toppest university perform?</span><br><br>
                    This visualisation shows each country's toppest university score distribution. We can see that in UK
                    and USA's distribution, the major scores difference is at <span class ='scores_text'>citations per faculty</span>. UK has fewer
                    citations than USA's toppest university. This visualisation clearly demonstrates each countries top
                    1 university's weakness and strength. Even though they are all top 1 universities in each country,
                    there may have some type of score very close to zero. It directly shows the gap between each
                    country's university level.

                    <span class='title_text'>How does the rank changes in top 10 universities?</span><br><br>
                    The visualisation shows the ranking changes over 4 years on top 10 universities. It is so
                    surprising that ranks 1, 2, 3 remain no changes over 4 years. Plus, the top 10 universities list
                    remains no changes as well, there is no new university that gets in top 10 in these 4 years. These
                    facts show that it is extremely difficult to become a top 10 university, these universities are
                    the pride of the world's education.
                    <br>
                    There are several interesting points in this visualisation. First, the University of Cambridge
                    ranking
                    is declining annually for 4 years from rank 4 to rank 7. Second, Zth Zurich climbed from rank 10 to
                    rank 6 for only 3 years. Although it seems a lot different between rank 10 and 6, there are over
                    25,000 universities in the world, rank 10 to rank 6 is still the top 10 of 25000+ universities.
